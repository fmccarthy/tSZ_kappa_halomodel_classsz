# tSZ_kappa_halomodel_classsz

Computing tSZ-kappa cross correlation in class_sz, as described in McCarthy & Hill 2023  [arXiv:2308.16260](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16260).

The notebook here shows how to compute the tSZ-kappa cross correlation using class_sz: https://github.com/CLASS-SZ/class_sz

Please make sure class_sz is installed before running the notebook (detailed installation instructions are available in the class_sz README). The notebook is valid for the version of class_sz updated as of Aug 31 2023 (commit number 0a0c59617e0869b4de73e0bb015fd7de57a6e44c).


Other requirements: numpy, matplotlib, all other requirements for class_sz

### Acknowledgments

Many thanks to Boris Bolliet for writing class_sz and for many consultations while using class_sz to compute this signal
